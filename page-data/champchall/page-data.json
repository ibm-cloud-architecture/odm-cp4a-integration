The *challenger* is the new version of the decision that will also be deployed to the production environment to be tested against the champion. When the decision is called, a portion (usually a majority) of the traffic will be routed to the champion, and the remainder to the challenger.\n\nThe goal is then to capture execution details for both versions and compare them using the desired KPIs. Actual implementation of the routing depends on the application integration approach that you want to use.
