title: Large scale simulations
description: Implementation of large scale simulations on Spark
---

One of the exciting part of using ODM in conjunction with CP4D is the ability ofeasily run large scale simulation of decision services by running them on a Spark grid. This chapter presents the basis for this approach and takes you through the actual implementation.

## Embedding decision service execution

## Jupyter notebook

The following notebook (source is available [here](../../../../notebook/ODM Integration Job Engine.ipynb)) shows how to execute large scale ODM simulations on a Spark kernel.
