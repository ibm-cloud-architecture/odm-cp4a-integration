## What is champion-challenger?

Champion-challenger is a common decision-proofing practice in the banking and lending industries. It is very similar in principle to A/B testing, and is performed in a production environment.

The *champion* is the current version of the decision deployed in the production environment. The *challenger* is the new version of the decision that will also be deployed to the production environment to be tested against the champion. When the decision is called, a portion (usually a majority) of the traffic will be routed to the champion, and the remainder to the challenger.

The goal is then to capture execution details for both versions and compare them using the desired KPIs. Actual implementation of the routing depends on the application integration approach that you want to use. With the containerized version of ODM, there is no out of the box approach to manage this routing within the scope of the Rule Execution Server; in particular, the Ruleset Interceptor approach is not available for containerized deployments.

## A job for BAI

From a monitoring and analytics requirements capability, champion-challenger is an obvious candidate for using the [IBM Business Automation Insights](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYHZ8_20.0.x/com.ibm.dba.bai/topics/con_bai_overview_top.html) (BAI) component capabilities. BAI provides instant feedback on the champion and challenger behavior through dashboards. It then provides the ability to perform more complex segmentation and analysis based on the decision trace from each request execution.
