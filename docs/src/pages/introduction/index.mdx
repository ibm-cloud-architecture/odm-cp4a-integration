## Introduction 

This repository addresses different aspects of the integration of ODM decision services with Watson ML scoring services deployed on CP4D.

It addresses non-functional aspects such as security and performance, as well as functional aspects such as best practices for WML service invocation from ODM, or making choices in the design of the ODM execution and business object model.

The repository is part of a larger collection of [Digital Business Automation best practices and reusable content](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-dba/introduction/overview/) for deploying solutions using IBM Cloud Pak for Automation components.
